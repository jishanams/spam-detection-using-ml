Why these models were chosen?

Logistic Regression is a simple linear model commonly used for binary classification problems like spam vs. not spam. It provides fast training and gives interpretable results.
Random Forest is an ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees. It handles nonlinear relationships, detects feature interactions, and usually gives higher accuracy for tabular data. That’s why both were tested to compare performance.

Feature impact on prediction :

num_links - More links usually increases chance of spam
num_words - Very small messages can indicate spam
has_offer - Presence of "special offer" keywords increases spam probability
sender_score - Lower sender reputation increases spam probability
all_caps - Messages in ALL CAPS often indicate spam
